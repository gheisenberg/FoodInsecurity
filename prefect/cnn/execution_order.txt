The programs given in Github should be executed in the following way:

1. satellite_images_gee.ipynb 
    
    a) If needed (for downloading images to local desktop and deleting them on the Google Drive): gdrive-siphon.timer (which starts gdrive-siphon.service and hence, gdrive-siphon.sh)

2. Sorting_sentinel-img_into_zips.ipynb 

3. creating_water_source_files.ipynb (Please note that you can already start this program as soon as the csv-files where created (and sorted into before and after 2013 survey) in the program satellite_images_gee.ipynb)

4. Get_corresponding_GE_HR_survey_files.ipynb

5. CNN_urban.ipynb
